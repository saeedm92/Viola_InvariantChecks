Install Coq and OCaml.

Download CompCert 2.4 from http://compcert.inria.fr/ and unpack it here.
Rename its directory to compcert (or create a symlink).

In the compcert directory:

  ./configure arm-eabihf
  make
  make clightgen
  make documentation

Get back to the parent directory and run ./compile_viola.  Ignore the warnings.

Run ./vtests/test_genasm.native > n5_cam_vib_invariant.S to save the checks in assembly (in the case the generated invariant is the cam->vib invariant). To change the invariant, edit the vtests/test_genasm.ml file.
